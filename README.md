# StonePaperScissor

Stone Paper Scissors is an interactive, browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by the classic hand game known worldwide. This project showcases essential frontend development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and real-time feedback — all wrapped in a fun, minimalist UI.

The goal is to offer a smooth and enjoyable game experience where the player competes against the computer in rounds of “stone” (rock), “paper,” or “scissors.” The game determines the winner based on traditional rules and updates the interface dynamically to reflect the results.

 # Features
User-Friendly Interface: Clean layout with buttons representing each choice (Stone, Paper, Scissors).

Randomized Computer Choice: Uses JavaScript's random number generation to simulate a fair opponent.

Instant Outcome Display: After each turn, the game clearly announces whether the player won, lost, or tied.

Score Tracking (Optional): Some versions may include win/loss counters to track the session's performance.

Internal CSS Styling: Responsive and styled entirely within the HTML for compactness and simplicity.

Replayability: Players can continuously click and play multiple rounds without refreshing the page.

 # Learning Objectives Demonstrated
Mastery of JavaScript Math.random() and control structures

Responsive event-driven interactions with onclick handlers

Logical condition trees (if-else) to determine game results

Simple UI feedback using innerHTML and CSS styling
