# StonePaperScissor
The Stone Paper Scissors project is a classic web-based implementation of the well-known hand game, designed to be simple, interactive, and accessible directly in the browser. Built using HTML, internal CSS, and JavaScript, the project serves as a fun way to demonstrate essential frontend development concepts while offering a playful, user-driven experience.

The game begins with a clean and intuitive interface that presents the player with three clickable options: Stone, Paper, and Scissors. Upon selection, the game instantly triggers JavaScript logic that randomly generates the computer’s move and compares it to the player’s choice. Based on the game rules — where stone beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats stone — the outcome is calculated and displayed dynamically on the screen.

The UI is styled using internal CSS, keeping the entire project compact and self-contained. Feedback is immediate and visual, with results like “You Win,” “You Lose,” or “It's a Draw!” shown after every round. This real-time interaction loop enhances user engagement and simulates the excitement of the original game.

Although this version is kept simple without score tracking or animations, the logic is fully extendable. It’s an excellent example of how to handle user events (onclick), manipulate the DOM with JavaScript, and use conditional statements to drive game logic.

From an educational standpoint, this project is great for beginners to practice:

Basic HTML layout and structuring

Styling with CSS inside <style> tags

JavaScript functions, variables, and conditionals

Random number generation using Math.random()

Updating UI content with innerHTML

This project is ready for deployment via GitHub Pages, making it easy to share online through your resume or portfolio. It’s lightweight, fast-loading, and can run on any modern browser without installation or setup.
